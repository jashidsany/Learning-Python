# The two escape sequences we will cover here are
# \n Newline
# \t Horizontal Tab
# Newline or \n will allow us to split a multi-line string by line breaks and \t will allow us to split a string by tabs. \t is particularly useful when dealing with certain datasets because it is not uncommon for data points to be separated by tabs.

"""The sky has given over
its bitterness.
Out of the dark change
all day long
rain falls and falls
as if it would never end.
Still the snow keeps
its hold on the ground.
But water, water
from a thousand runnels!
It collects swiftly,
dappled with black
cuts a way for itself
through green ice in the gutters.
Drop after drop it falls
from the withered grass-stems
of the overhanging embankment."""
