You’ve learned:

what modules are and how they can be useful
how to use a few of the most commonly used Python libraries
what namespaces are and how to avoid polluting your local namespace
how scope works for files in Python
Programmers can do great things if they are not forced to constantly reinvent tools that have already been built. With the power of modules, we can import any code that someone else has shared publicly.

In this lesson, we covered some of the Python Standard Library, but you can explore all the modules that come packaged with every installation of Python at the Python Standard Library documentation.

This is just the beginning. Using a package manager (like conda or pip3), you can install any modules available on the Python Package Index.

The sky’s the limit!
