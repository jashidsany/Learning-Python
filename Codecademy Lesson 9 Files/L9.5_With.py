# The with keyword invokes something called a context manager for the file that weâ€™re calling open() on.
# This context manager takes care of opening the file when we call open() and then closing the file after we leave the indented block
# The with syntax replaces older ways to access files where you need to call .close() on the file object manually.
# We can still open up a file and append to it with the old syntax, as long as we remember to close the file connection afterwards
