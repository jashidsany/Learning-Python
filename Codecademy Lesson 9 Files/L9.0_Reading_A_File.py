# Computers use file systems to store and retrieve data.
# Each file is an individual container of related information.
# If you’ve ever saved a document, downloaded a song, or even sent an email you’ve created a file on some computer somewhere.
# Even script.py, the Python program you’re editing in the learning environment, is a file.
# So, how do we interact with files using Python?
# We’re going to learn how to read and write different kinds of files using code.
# Let’s say we had a file called real_cool_document.txt with these contents:
# real_cool_document.txt
# Wowsers!
# We could read that file like this:
# script.py
# with open('real_cool_document.txt') as cool_doc:
#  cool_contents = cool_doc.read()
# print(cool_contents)
# This opens a file object called cool_doc and creates a new indented block where you can read the contents of the opened file.
# We then read the contents of the file cool_doc using cool_doc.read() and save the resulting string into the variable cool_contents.
# Then we print cool_contents, which outputs the statement Wowsers!.

with open('welcome.txt') as text_file:
  text_data = text_file.read()
print(text_data)
