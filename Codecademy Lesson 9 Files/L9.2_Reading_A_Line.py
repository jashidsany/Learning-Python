# Sometimes you don’t want to iterate through a whole file. For that, there’s a different file method, .readline(), which will only read a single line at a time. # If the entire document is read line by line in this way subsequent calls to-
# -.readline() will not throw an error but will start returning an empty string (""). # Suppose we had this file:
# millay_sonnet.txt
# I shall forget you presently, my dear,
# So make the most of this, your little day,
# Your little month, your little half a year,
# Ere I forget, or die, or move away,
# script.py
# with open('millay_sonnet.txt') as sonnet_doc:
#  first_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
#  second_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
#  print(second_line)
# This script also creates a file object called sonnet_doc that points to the file millay_sonnet.txt.
# It then reads in the first line using sonnet_doc.readline() and saves that to the variable first_line.
# It then saves the second line (So make the most of this, your little day,) into the variable second_line and then prints it out.

with open('just_the_first.txt') as first_line_doc:
  first_line = first_line_doc.readline()
  print(first_line)
