# We import the csv library, and then open a new CSV file in write-mode by passing the 'w' argument to the open() function.
# We then define the fields weâ€™re going to be using into a variable called fields. We then instantiate our CSV writer object and pass two arguments.
# The first is output_csv, the file handler object.
# The second is our list of fields fields which we pass to the keyword parameter fieldnames.
#  First we want the headers, so we call .writeheader() on the writer object.
# This writes all the fields passed to fieldnames as the first row in our file.
# Then we iterate through our big_list of data.
# Each item in big_list is a dictionary with each field in fields as the keys.
# We call output_writer.writerow() with the item dictionaries which writes each line to the CSV file.
