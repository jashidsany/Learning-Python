# Isn’t there a way to just add a line to a file without completely deleting it? Of course there is!
# Instead of opening the file using the argument 'w' for write-mode, we open it with 'a' for append-mode. If we have a generated file with the following contents:
# generated_file.txt
# This was a popular file...
# Then we can add another line to that file with the following code:
# script.py
# with open('generated_file.txt', 'a') as gen_file:
#  gen_file.write("... and it still is")
# In the code above we open a file object in the temporary variable gen_file. # This variable points to the file generated_file.txt and, since it’s open in append-mode, adds the line ... and it still is as a new line to the file.
# If you were to open the file after running the script it would look like this:
# generated_file.txt
# This was a popular file...
# ... and it still is
# Notice that opening the file in append-mode, with 'a' as an argument to open(), means that using the file object’s .write() method appends whatever is passed to the end of the file in a new line.
# If we were to run script.py again, this would be what generated_file.txt looks like:
# generated_file.txt
# This was a popular file...
# ... and it still is
# ... and it still is
# Notice that we’ve appended "... and it still is" to the file a second time! This is because in script.py we opened generated_file.txt in append-mode

with open('cool_dogs.txt', 'a') as cool_dogs_file:
