# To add a single key : value pair to a dictionary, we can use the syntax:
# my_dict["new_key"] = "new_value"
# For example, if we had our menu object from the first exercise:
# menu = {"oatmeal": 3, "avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}
# and we wanted to add a new item, "cheesecake" for 8 dollars, we could use:
# menu["cheesecake"] = 8
# Now, menu looks like:
# {"oatmeal": 3, "avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2, "cheesecake": 8}
