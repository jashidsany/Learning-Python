# Dictionaries also have a .keys() method that returns a dict_keys object.
# A dict_keys object is a view object, which provides a look at the current state of the dictionary, without the user being able to modify anything.
# The dict_keys object returned by .keys() is a set of the keys in the dictionary.
# You cannot add or remove elements from a dict_keys object, but it can be used in the place of a list for iteration:
# for student in test_scores.keys():
#  print(student)
#will yield:
# "Grace"
# "Jeffrey"
# "Sylvia"
# "Pedro"
# "Martin"
# "Dina"
