# Polymorphism is the term used to describe the same syntax (like the + operator here, but it could be a method name) doing different actions depending on the type of data.
# Polymorphism is an abstract concept that covers a lot of ground, but defining class hierarchies that all implement the same interface is a way of introducing polymorphism to our code.
