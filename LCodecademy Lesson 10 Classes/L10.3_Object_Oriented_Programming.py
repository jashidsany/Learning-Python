# A class instance is also called an object.
# The pattern of defining classes and creating objects to represent the responsibilities of a program is known as Object Oriented Programming or OOP.
# Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object, the type() function does the opposite of that.
# When called with an object, it returns the class that the object is an instance of.
